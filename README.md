# Machine-Learning-L2

Mentorship Repository for Machine Learning Type = Level 2

## Repository Navigation Guide
* Mentor needs to fork this repository
* Mentee needs to joins as a contributor

This template is designed to assist Twoleaps mentorship program. The template consists of two 
major sections: Goals and Progress tracker. Mentors and mentee should add goals prior to start of 
mentorship. Goals should be such that both party agree on. Progress tracker is to be updated on week
by week basis with new tasks to complete the defined goals. For each week, a folder in the repository
has to be maintained which captures the work done. It can be a small essay of things learned or written
code etc.

## Providing Feedback

Regular feedback is highly encouraged. Feedbacks should inspire improvement. Mentors should summarize week by week progress in form of feedback whenever possible and add it to the weekly work folder in form of *week1/feedback.md*
